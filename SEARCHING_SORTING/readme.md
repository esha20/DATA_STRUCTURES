Implementing different sorting and searching algorithms.

~ Bubble Sort :- It sorts by repeatedly sorting the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
                 It is snot suitable for large data sets.
                 Worst case occurs when the array is reverse sorted. Time complexity :- O(n^2)
                 Best case occurs when the array is sorted. Time Complexity :- O(n)
                 Total number of swaps or comparison in worst case :- n(n-1)/2
                 Stable sort and is in place.
