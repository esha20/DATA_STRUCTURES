Implementing different sorting and searching algorithms.

~ Bubble Sort :- It sorts by repeatedly sorting the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
                 It is snot suitable for large data sets.
                 Worst case occurs when the array is reverse sorted. Time complexity :- O(n^2)
                 Best case occurs when the array is sorted. Time Complexity :- O(n)
                 Total number of swaps or comparison in worst case :- n(n-1)/2
                 Stable sort and is in place.
                 
~ Insertion Sort :- Sorts by splitting the array in sorted and unsorted parts.
                    The elements from the unsorted parts are picked and placed in the correct order in the sorted part.
                    Efficient for small data values.
                    It is adaptive in nature (not good for partially sorted array).
                    Worst case time Complexity :- O(n^2)
                    It is inplace and stable.
